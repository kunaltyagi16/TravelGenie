## Introduction

Welcome to the TravelGenie - LLM Powered Recommendation System repository!
This project is designed to provide personalized and expert travel recommendations to users who are planning vacations or trips. The system leverages advanced natural language processing techniques, and Google Flan XL or GPT-3.5 for natural and intuitive conversational planning.

## Project Overview

The TechDesk Recommendation System involves:
- **Conversational AI**: The system interacts with end users through Google Flan XL or GPT-3.5, leveraging the stored embeddings to provide personalized recommendations and expert advice in real-time.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the TravelGenie project stemmed from the common hesitation many individuals face when planning vacations or trips. The stress of organizing travel details, uncertainty in choosing the right destination, and lack of reliable guidance often make trip planning overwhelming. By offering personalized and expert advice through an AI-powered recommendation system, we aim to simplify the planning process and empower users to make confident, well-informed travel decisions.

## Market Research

Our initial market research indicated that 57% of individuals were not confident in wanting to spend money on vacations. To delve deeper, we conducted a user survey to understand the reasons behind this hesitation.

## User Survey

In our user survey:
- 57% of respondents indicated they avoid traveling because they don’t want to spend money.
- 21% of respondents said they avoid traveling due to the time and stress involved in vacation planning.

These findings underscore the need for a recommendation system that can alleviate planning stress and provide cost-conscious, expert travel advice—empowering users to plan trips with greater ease and confidence.
